# Facebook-clone 
Simple Front-End web app made with React, Firebase, and Material-UI. 

### About 

This is one of my first React web-projects.
I created the homepage of Facebook and added some simple options like posting/adding image to your wall
and the ability to log in(authenticate) with your Google account.


### Technologies I'm using:


#### `REACT` - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

#### `FIREBASE` - Gives you an Effortless and easy to work with back-end cloud base platform to host and lunch your project. 

#### `MATERIAL-UI` - Material-UI provides an optional CssBaseline component and a nice and simple way to add style buttons, icons, and more. 





### `Launch the project` - You have 2 options to lunch: 

1. Go for the easy way and lunch/watch the project in firebase host here - https://facebook-clone-de286.web.app

2. Use `npm start` after you download the git repository.  





### Please make you have both Material-UI and FIREBASE installed if you run on your machine.

#### MATERIAL-UI -  `npm install @material-ui/core` **or** `yarn add @material-ui/core`

#### FIREBASE - `npm install -g firebase-tools`
